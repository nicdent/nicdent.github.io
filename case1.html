                    <h2>Role</h2>
                    <p>I was the Senior UX / UI Designer during a large redesign of the realcommercial experiences. The redesign was planned in conjunction with multiple upgrades to technology. These dual goals meant for an iterative overhaul of all parts of the realcommercial experience.</p> 
                    <p>The realcommercial design team consisted of a responsive web designer and a native app designer. Designers are imbedded within cross-functional agile teams for projects, at times designers are imbedded within multiple teams. The realcommercial design team utilised an adapted double diamond design process that aligned with the overall business rhythm.</p>
                    <p>The wider REA Group design team of 40+ designers and researchers worked together developing process efficiencies and design systems.</p>

                    <h2>Projects</h2>
                    <p>I was responsible for responsive web projects but at times paired with the native app designer on larger native app projects. All projects across web and native apps required designer collaboration to deliver holistic experiences for users.</p>
                    <p>Here is a selection of projects where I was the lead designer:</p>
