                    <p>The projects I worked on were an existing small business website builder and a new online invoicing experience.</p>
                    <p>My responsibilities during projects:</p>
                    <ul class="project-responsibilities">
                        <li>User research &amp; testing</li>

                </div>
                           

                <div class="main-content project">
                    <img class="desktop-screen" src="img/desktop-screen-myinvoice.png" alt="">

                        <h3>Online Invoicing</h3>
                        <p>Small businesses need their invoices to be paid on time to stay cash flow positive so they can focus on new revenue opportunities.</p>
                        <p>The existing MYOB accounting products utilised an outdated invoicing experience that simply forwarded an email with a PDF attachment of an invoice to customers.</p>
                        <p>The invoicing experience now allows small businesses to send online invoices from all major MYOB accounting products. Businesses can easily track the invoice progress through the activity feed with delivery and customer interactions shown. Customers can now easily pay online cutting down the average days to pay.</p>
                        <p>I was responsible for the responsive web experience design.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="main-content project">

                    <div class="project-text">
                        <h3>BETA Online Invoicing Lab</h3>
                        <p>Existing MYOB users wanted to try new experiences to improve their invoicing process but still wanted a full view of how their invoices were delivered.</p>
                        <p>A BETA product using APIs to send invoices from a major accounting app became the initial MVP of the online invoicing experience. The build time was much faster by not disrupting the existing product. Experiments with real users and monitoring real invoices sent with the BETA service unlocked great quantitative data.</p>
